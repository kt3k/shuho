<ul>
<li>Deno switched its internal TypeScript into JavaScript this week. The team even dropped the usages of <code>import</code> and instead started concating all the files. Personally I think this isn't the way to write JavaScript in 2020 and the benefit seems a little obscure compared to its disadvantages ü§î</li>

<h3 id="user-content-poly_soft-article"><code>poly_soft</code> article</h3>
<ul>
<li>YouTuber Tech speaker <code>@poly_soft</code> wrote a confusing and contraversial <a href="https://qiita.com/poly_soft/items/712da982eedf65066fdb">article</a> this week. He compares learning technologies to the street fighting and he argue that such type of learning will be meaningless eventually and that an engineer needs to figure out a different way to earn more presence in the society other than just learning technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-oidc">OIDC</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was learning about OpenID Connect for a long time for researching the feasibility of google authentication of AWS AppSync from expo application. I finally got an <code>id_token</code> of google from my expo client this week. It was a hard time to get the right parameters for my need.</li>

<li>
<p>Went to Kyoto with Iyo this week. It was amazing wonderful time.</p>
<p>We went to an restaurant called "calf" and it was an amazing lunch.</p>
<p>We also went to Kennin-ji, 33-Gen-Do, Kiyomizu-dera, Kyoto University, etc. We stayed at Matsui Honkan.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>My phone, Pixel 3a, died this week because of falling from my hand in a bus. This was my first time to break a phone completely by dropping it from my hand. I bought Huawei nova lite 3 instead. It costed just 20,000 yen and it's been working nicely for now ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
