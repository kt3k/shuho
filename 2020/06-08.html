<ul>
<li>
<p>Continued the development of Tententen. This week I created the splash screen sequence of the app. It was a quite pleasant work using <a href="https://github.com/capsidjs/capsid">capsid</a> and DOM APIs. <a href="https://github.com/capsidjs/capsid">capsid</a> really worked in this case again.</p>

<ul>
<li>We started applying to the room in Azabu. We need to go through many examinations from the next week.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-phone">Phone</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I bought a new phone, Google Pixel 3a, because my Huawei Mate 10 Pro was about to go broken. Mate 10 Pro had very good battery. I used to use the phone entire 2 days without charging it but now it's been reduced to the only one single day. Maybe the bettery has been damaged somehow. So I decided to change the phone now. I think I have used it for about 2 years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-iyo">Iyo</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This weekend I went to Jiyugaoka to see the furniture for the new room together with Iyo. We went to 2 shops, <a href="https://crashgate.jp/">CRASHGATE</a> and <a href="https://www.muji.com/">MUJI</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After visiting the furniture shops, we took a rest in Starbucks in Oimachi, where Iyo registered her GitHub account while drinking a frappucino. Then she asked me that how many combinations there exists for GitHub default icon (meaning github identicon), and I answered 32768 immediately without using any paper or calculator. She looked really shocked (maybe because she didn't think such an answer was possible) and she started saying "I have to become a person who deserves you". I answered "You already deserve me".</p>
