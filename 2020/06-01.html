<h3 id="user-content-react-native">React Native</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bought the book, React Native, written by @januswel, @YutamaKotaro, and @nitaking. It's a very nice, modern and practical introduction to React Native. It also covers the modern basic topics like TypeScript and ES6+. It's definitely a book I can recommend to anybody who consider starting creating cross platform apps.</p>

<p>Tententen is a mobile generative art app. <a href="https://github.com/monoidcc/Tententen">https://github.com/monoidcc/Tententen</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Resumed the development of Tententen. This week I researched about available fonts on Android devices. The available fonts on Android were very different from those of iOS. The web site called <a href="https://wordmark.it">wordmark.it</a> was very helpful for finding out what was available on Android.</li>

<h3 id="user-content-new-room">New room</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're looking for a new room these days. This weekend we went to Azabu for seeing the inside of a candidate room which we've been considering about. It was a very nice room, had lots of nice storages. The living room was nice and big enough. The entrance and corridor were very nice and like a fancy hotel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-a-dress">A dress</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iyo bought a new summer dress. It was very nice and I really loved it :)</p>
