<blockquote>
<p>The weeknote for 11/16 - 11/22.</p>

<h2 id="myproject">MyProject</h2>
<h3 id="tententen">Tententen</h3>
<p>Tententen is an mobile generative art app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented message handlings of success and failures of download and sharing by using the components "toast" and "confirm". Nice progress in this week as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="job">Job</h2>
<h3 id="apple-developer-enterprise-program">Apple Developer Enterprise Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This week we finally succeeded to upload our app to our own App Store which we created by writing HTML and CSS by hands.</p>
<p>I didn't know what the Enterprise Program is for before this time and had really hard time to find out the right way to distribute our apps in this situation. After researching various sources, I finally found out that we can make our own App Store for our apps, and there are various "solutions" for this type of distribution such as DeployGate, etc. After comparing such solutions, I found that we didn't need any of these and we could create our own shop with just a little lines of HTML and XML (The xml is called manifest.plist). So the result was a simple web page with download link to our in-house app and my colleague and I was able to download and install it from that link. It was a nice Aha experince!</p>
</li>

<h3 id="ryan">Ryan</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ryan Dahl emailed me a little before that he wanted to chat with me. This week we met in Google Meet and talked a little about Deno, the work he's now working on, my careers and experiences, etc. It was really a precious time to meet with the person who created Node.js and shaped the recent history of software evolution.</p>
<p>He was nice to me, listened to me carefully. It was a little surprising to me that he didn't miss almost any of my words (I'm very used to being said "Pardon?" because of my strange accent. Maybe he's used to hearing the various international accents). It was a really nice 40-minute talk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iyos-42-application">Iyo's 42 application</h3>
<ul>
<li>She applied to <a href="https://42tokyo.jp/">42 tokyo</a> and passed the web test! The next week she's going to join their entrance examination called "piscine".</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuu">Fuu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spent with Fuu-chan one week and we've found she's very different from her sister Nino-chan. Nino-chan was more like a lady, but Fuu-chan is more like a baby.</p>
