<li>
<p>Rebased <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/5276">#5276</a> to land it finally! It needed some work. Deno core seems still developing quite quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posted <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/7127">#7127</a>, a minor fix in build process. The above change extracts the typescript version from typescript's bundled source code. I learned several APIs in rust's std library in it. I was impressed by <code>chars()</code> method of string, which returns a iterator of chars. You can call methods like <code>skip_while</code> or <code>take_while</code> on it. It feels very high level language, but its actual meaning is very low level.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gave up using <code>@lepont/share</code> and therefore <code>react-native-share</code> for sharing images in android devices because it seemed broken on Huawei devices. I started looking for the way to "save" the image on the device instead of "share". First I tried <code>&#x3C;a download></code> tag in webview for saving images. This would be the simplest one if it would have worked but it doesn't work because android doesn't handle <code>data:</code> scheme (This was quite surprising to me because data uri has been a part of web standard for years). Then I tried <code>@react-native-community/cameraroll</code>. This worked on iOS, but it didn't on android. The library doesn't work with base64 images on Android devices. That was a known issue. Next week I'll try <code>react-native-fs</code> for saving the images first on android devices, and then save it using <code>cameraroll</code>. I wish it will work.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I changed the APIs of main entry hook this week in <a href="https://github.com/kt3k/lepont/pull/4/files">#4</a>.</p>
<p>Before it was:</p>
<pre><code>const registry = useRegistry();
useBridge(registry, name, impl);
</code></pre>
<p>Now it is:</p>
<pre><code>const [ref, onMessage] = useBridge((registry) =>
  registry.register(name, impl)
);
</code></pre>
<p>This is simpler, clearer, well-typed. I like this version very much!</p>

<p>Iyo-chan and I went to Toyosu and Tsukishima this weekend. It was a nice walk in a summer day!</p>
<p>We visited a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monjayaki">monjayaki</a> shop, Tsukushiya. It was so nice and delicious!!</p>

<li>
<p>Iyo-chan and I went to Takano Fruit Parlour on Sunday. It was absolutely, stunningly delicious!! It was a little pricey, but I recommend this place to everyone, especially the visitors from abroad should go there if you have time. We had Seasonal Trifle of Peach (front) and Fruit Plate of Peach (back).</p>
