### denoland/deno

Deno is a new JS/TS runtime.

    I tried to do the bundle-before-install again. This time I added `--no-bundle` option to optionally avoid the bundling. The new version successfully installs file_server example, but many real world examples don't work well with bundling. It seems that a few bugs are still remaining in bundling itself.

## Tech

### Iyo's piscine

- Iyo's been still continuing piscine. This week she learned a lot of C language. It's almost the first programming language for her. She looked really struggling to understand every feature. Among many features of C, the pointers especially confused her so much.

## Life

### Deno Land, Inc.

- The previous meetings with Ryan and Bert were about inviting me to their company Deno Land, Inc. After having talked with Bert, Ryan booked another meeting with me. We talked about the time when I can join them, the compensation, etc, and we agreed that I'm going to join them in January. After about 5~6 days, I received a legal document (online) about the contract. I signed it, and Ryan signed it. So I'm going to join the company in January and work full-time on Deno and the services around it.
