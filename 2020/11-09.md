## MyProject

### Tententen

Tententen is an mobile generative art app.

- Implemented list-modal. It looks very nice now. Storybook works very much. This is definitely a part of the best practice.

## Life

### Iyo's study of web

- She learned `@keyframes` and CSS animation. Now her site looks like geocities in its peak 😂 https://iyochan.love/ .

### Nino

- Nino, a 10-year-old cavalier king charles spaniel, passed away on Tuesday. She gave us a lot of love always. RIP.

  She was eating, walking even on the last day of her life.

### Fuu

- Iyo-chan's mother came to our home from Mie prefecture on Tuesday night to mourn the death of Nino together with Fuu-chan, a 1-year-and-10-month-old cavalier king charles spaniel.

  After attending the funeral of Nino, her mother went back to Mie, but Fuu-chan decided to stay our house to heal the saddened heart of Iyo-chan.
