<li>@sebmck finally revealed Rome this week. It's very difficult to describe it in this early stage, but what the author tries to do with Rome looks absolutely huge. He seems trying to change everything in the JavaScript ecosystem. I feel that the impact of Rome to the JavaScript ecosystem can be comparable to that of Deno.</li>

<h3 id="marriage-hunting">Marriage Hunting</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I started Marriage Hunting (Konkatsu, 婚活) publicly on twitter. Marriage hunting is a common practice in Japan these days, in which people show their profiles and search the partners. Maybe there is a similar counterpart in every country. Nowadays some people started doing it on twitter because some marriage hunting sites / systems are very expensive, and sometimes they are not such effective. I haven't tried such usual Konkatsu sites or organizations yet, but I started directly twitter-Konkatsu because I'm quite comfortable in twitter and here is the best place to show who I am exactly. Then therefore I opened my profile on twitter like the below (sorry for English speaking readers):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">よろしくお願いします<br>性別：男<br>年齢：37<br>身長：181<br>体型：普通<br>住所：杉並区<br>学歴：京都大学<br>お酒：少し<br>煙草：吸わない<br>職業：Web エンジニア<br>年収：1,400万+<br>休日：土日祝<br>性格：やさしい、温厚、インドア派<br>結婚：したい<br>子供：欲しい<br>趣味：プログラミング、散歩、旅行<br>備考：バツ1<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitter%E5%A9%9A%E6%B4%BB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#twitter婚活</a></p>&mdash; Yoshiya/肩/Deno澤 (@kt3k) <a href="https://twitter.com/kt3k/status/1232088866103783426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I opened my education, my height (lol, but it's important in this context), and even my salary. This is an absolutely ridiculus boasting which annoys everyone, and I usually don't like to do the thing like this, but I really have to find a partner near future because of my age. So that's one of the reason I did this. Another reason is that people in Japanese tech scene hardly share the salaries. People don't know each other's salary in most cases even between close friends. I felt that's not healthy. So I wanted to open my salary since a while ago.</p>
<p>The reaction to the above was enormous. Many people retweeted and liked the above tweet. Most are total strangers. So it reached so many people who I didn't know before. In two days, 2 persons actually asked for starting the negotiation. I already declined both suggestions because of their ages.</p>
<p>I wish this will result something good for me 🙏</p>
