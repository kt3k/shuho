<h3 id="atcoder-beginner-contest-187">AtCoder Beginner Contest 187</h3>
<ul>
<li>Participated in AtCoder Beginner Contest 187. This time I prepared input utilities before the contest at <a href="https://github.com/kt3k/atcoder-prelude">https://github.com/kt3k/atcoder-prelude</a> . It worked very well. I save a lot of time solving first 4 problems thanks to these input utilities. I thought I could solve the 5th problem because I had more than 40 minutes for it. When I made the first draft solution for it, my solution exceeded the time limit for the later 13 test cases. Something was wrong. I tried some optimizations, but they didn't work. Finally I was unable to solve the 5th problem. After finishing the contest, I read the official explanation of the problem. They recommend using the imos method. I've never understood imos method before but this time I read it very carefully and I finally was able to solve it using imos method ( <a href="https://github.com/kt3k/abc187/blob/master/e.js">https://github.com/kt3k/abc187/blob/master/e.js</a> ). It was really clever way to solve this sort of problems.</li>

<ul>
<li>I started reading a book called "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari. I'm still in the middle of reading the book, but it makes a lot of interesting points, and gives a lot of ideas in how to see the history of our civilization. Totally worth reading!</li>
