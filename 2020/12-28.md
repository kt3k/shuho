## Tech

### AtCoder Beginner Contest 187

- Participated in AtCoder Beginner Contest 187. This time I prepared input utilities before the contest at https://github.com/kt3k/atcoder-prelude . It worked very well. I save a lot of time solving first 4 problems thanks to these input utilities. I thought I could solve the 5th problem because I had more than 40 minutes for it. When I made the first draft solution for it, my solution exceeded the time limit for the later 13 test cases. Something was wrong. I tried some optimizations, but they didn't work. Finally I was unable to solve the 5th problem. After finishing the contest, I read the official explanation of the problem. They recommend using the imos method. I've never understood imos method before but this time I read it very carefully and I finally was able to solve it using imos method ( https://github.com/kt3k/abc187/blob/master/e.js ). It was really clever way to solve this sort of problems.

## Book

### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

- I started reading a book called "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari. I'm still in the middle of reading the book, but it makes a lot of interesting points, and gives a lot of ideas in how to see the history of our civilization. Totally worth reading!

## Life

### Retrospective

- I looked back at 2020 in [a scrapbox note](https://scrapbox.io/kt3k/2020). It was a busy year.

### New year

- I spent with Iyo-chan around the new year day. We had lunch together in a lounge in 4 seasons hotel in Otemachi.
