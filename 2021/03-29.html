<blockquote>

<h3 id="user-content-denolanddeno">denoland/deno</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>serde_v8</code> was <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/9843">merged</a> this week. This is a huge improvement in the performance of Deno, and also a huge improvement in the organization of Op implementation code. This is one of the greatest progresses in a while. The surprising thing about this is that this item wasn't on the roadmap at all. This has been all started by a completely new contributor @AaronO (Aaron O'Mullan). Nobody had expected such thing would happen. I think I've seen a very interesting phenomenon which only happens in the OSS world.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-content-deno-land">Deno Land</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deno Land finally announced it formed the company in its blog.</p>
<p>And at the same time, Deno Deploy has been revealed by the link in the header, and a lot of people started using it. I was overwhelmed by the huge amount of the information around the announcement and the release.</p>
<p>Iyo-chan prepared the cake for this release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-web-vitals">Web Vitals</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Friday on my advisor job in LightCafe creation, I researched about Web Vitals. This seems an improved version of Lighthouse. The definition of LCP looks very complicated, but at the same time it makes sense to me that this metrics is more important than FCP or FMP. Measuring of performance is evolving as well as the other technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-content-js-built-in-modules">JS Built-in Modules</h3>
<ul>
<li>A few years ago js built-in modules were announced as a proposal, and I found it was interesting. However this week I found that @domenic gave up that proposal in 2019. The reason was stated in <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/421#issuecomment-561705979">this comment</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-event">Event</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-deno-ja-10">deno-ja #10</h3>
<ul>
<li>We had 10th deno-ja meetup on Sunday. I talked with @magurotuna and @uki00a for the first time. It was a great opportunity. Thank you @syumai for organizing this again. @magurotuna presented the basics of the internals of <code>deno_lint</code> crate, and that talk was very helpful to me. Some people were playing around Deno Deploy. I couldn't do anything significant during the meetup, but anyway it was a great opportunity to meet the people who use Deno in some way.</li>
