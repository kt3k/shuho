### Iyo-chan's Birthday

- 24th of July was Iyo-chan's birthday. We went to Hermès in Ginza and bought a watch which Iyo-chan wanted for a long time, and also had birthday lunch in Shiseido parlour.

## Hobby

### ETCS

- This week I started learning ETCS, Elementary Theory of Category of Sets. This is a category-theoretical version of set theory, which is usually presented as ZFC axioms. ZFC is often considered as one of the standard of the foundation of mathematics, but ETCS is another approach to the foundation of mathematics. During learning the axioms in ETCS, the definition of limit in category theoretical sense was so difficult. I'm still in the middle of the process of understanding it. The definition requires other definitions such as diagrams, natural transformations, etc. It's overwhelmingly difficult.

  I've been learning it in order to decide which theory to choose as the basis of the proover language I'm going to build in the future. I first naively planned to use ZFC as the basics, but after learning about versions of theorem proovers such as HOL, Coq, Lean, Metamath, Mizar, Isabelle, Idris, Twelf, etc, I feel ZFC is probably an unnatural choice as a foundation. So now I'm looking for an alternative theory for my proover language.
