### kt3k/packup

- This week I updated packup to add support of sass compilation. It was unexpectedly difficult as there was no immediately available version of sass in Deno ecosystem. After trying several versions of sass, I found [sass.js](https://github.com/medialize/sass.js/) was the easiest path forward. The distributed script of sass.js were almost working in Deno. I modified a few places of it to avoid non compatible code paths and finally I was able to make it run in Deno. The `@import` statement is still not supported, but it's at least able to compile a single file sass source code now.

## Event

### Aladdin

- Iyo-chan and I went to the theatre of Shiki to see the musical version of Aladdin. It was a fantastic show!

### Denobata

- @magurotuna, @uki00a, @syumai, and I started a new Japanese Deno chat event called denobata kaigi monthly. Denobata is a portmanteau of the 2 words: Deno + Idobata. Idobata means "around the well", and kaigi means "conference" in Japanese. Idobata Kaigi is a Japanese idiom, which literally means "The conference around the well", and actually means "chit-chat". So denobata kaigi roughly means "chit-chat about Deno". The event started at 13:00 on Sunday. It officially ended at 15:00, but unofficially continued until around 16:30. We talked about many random things around Deno.
