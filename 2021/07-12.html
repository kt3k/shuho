<h3 id="react-gui">React GUI</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seen some hype of unreleased module 'React GUI'. It looks like a rewrite and rebranding of React Native Web. Some RN Web enthusiasts look extremely excited about this leak-ish release.</p>
<p>But I don't like this type of re-invention of GUI type projects. All these kinds of efforts were defeated by the Web in the past, and in my view they keep defeated by the Web in the future. The Web looks sometimes odd in many aspects, but it's the most invested and the most battle tested platform for building GUI. So I predict this kind of attempts to try to "fix" the Web will never be successful in the future.</p>

<p>I often goes to Thai restaurant in Ebisu, called Mango tree on Friday. I like Phat kaphrao (It's called Gapao Rice here in Japan) and always have it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Found a very intersting list of mathematical theorems by Freek Wiedijk. This list contains 100 famous mathematical theorems and lists "formal proofs" of these theorems in various formal systems such as HOL Light, Coq, Isabelle, Lean, Metamath, Mizar, etc.</p>
<p>And then I started comparing these formal systems again (I tried some of them in the past, but I wasn't satisfied by any). I found Lean the best among these now because of its very very modern language design, but I'm still not satisfied by it in many aspects. I want to build my own one some day in the future.</p>
