## Tech

### Tailwind

- Started using Tailwind for the first time in my job. It wasn't such difficult to start as I had read in an article before. I even felt comfortable at least when I'm writing it. No need to name each small component. That felt unexpectedly pleasant to me.

## Job

### Deno Land

- This week was the first week in Deno Land. I was a little nervous, but anyway I started working!

## Life

### Afternoon Tea

- Iyo-chan and I went to the Imperial Hotel in Hibiya, Tokyo. We had Afternoon Tea sets there. It was amazingly good!
