<h3 id="ancient-greek-philosophy">Ancient Greek Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These days I've been reading the book 'The History of Greek Philosophy' (ギリシア哲学史) by Noburu Notomi. This week I've read about Thales and Anaximander. Thales didn't write any book, but he's often regarded as 'the first philosopher' in ancient Greece. He learned geometry in Egypt. He's famous for the episode of olive squeezer. Anaximander was the student of Thales. He wrote books about the nature, but those books were lost in the history. Those (lost) books are regarded as the first books written about the philosophy in the ancient Greece, and therefore in the western culture.</p>
<p>This book is very careful about what can be said about these very ancient philosophers, especially when the surviving materials are very few. The author is very critical about the credibility of the existing anecdotes attributed to those philosophers, and often dismisses some of those episodes as forged accounts.</p>

<p>Our baby is now at the 31st week. We had Baskin-Robins, 31 ice cream, to celebrate it (Iyo-chan, my partner, claims it's trending celemony in Japan to celebrate the 31st week with 31 ice cream though I'm not sure how much it's true).</p>
