<h3 id="user-content-kt3kpackup">kt3k/packup</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I announced <code>packup</code> project on Thursday. It's parcel like web app packager, but based on Deno. The module resolution is compatible with Deno, not Node.js. Internally it uses <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-tech">Tech</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-amp">AMP</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was an annoucement that Google stops the special treatment of the AMP website, rather it considers Web Vitals more valueable measures for page ranks. I welcome this change because AMP looked very weird technology to me, but I don't understand the decision of Google, which started AMP and stops AMP without giving enough reasoning behind it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-ie11">IE11</h3>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft announced that IE11 will be retired in June, 2022. This is an absolutely good news for the web ecosystem. Hello with evergreen browsers only world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-react-server-component">React Server Component</h3>
<ul>
<li>I researched a little bit about React Server Component as part of my job for LightCafe Creation. I didn't find much except the first annoucement of the technology. Probably they are working towards this direction, but I guess this isn't going well because RFC or other documents are not updated recent 4-5 months. That's too slow if the project making good progress. I also found that the main <code>react</code> npm package only updated 2 patch version since the release of <code>17.0.0</code>. There ware only 2 patch versions in 7 months. This is surprisingly slow update rate, but the commit counts are still high every month. So probably they are doing something big behind the scene (It might be concurrent mode?).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-hobby">Hobby</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-resident-evil-7--8">Resident Evil 7 &#x26; 8</h3>
<ul>
<li>For unknown reasons I recently enjoy watching the game play video of Resident Evil 7 &#x26; 8. These are the latest 2 of zombie horror game series Resident Evil from a Japanese game maker Capcom. I actually can't play these kind of games by myself, but watching the game play feels strangely enjoyable.</li>
