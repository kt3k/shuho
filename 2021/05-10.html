<p>Deno 1.10 was out this week üéâ Lots of improvement in testing function. Addition of localStorage, this is very interesting feature. By using localStorage, for example, a CLI tool can store some small configuration data based on localStorage, and no need of handling "config files". And it also added structured clone feature.</p>

<h3 id="user-content-facebookhermes">facebook/hermes</h3>
<p>Hermes is a JS engine built by facebook optimized for running React Native</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I haven't paid that much attention to Hermes engine because it doesn't have JIT optimization. The usage of it looked very limited. But this news surprised me a lot.</p>
<p>Hermes now strips the type annotation of typescript, which means the engine can execute typescript directly. I think this move is interesting in sereval ways. Striping type annotation is not difficult task. So it must be easy for implementors of engines to do that, and now TypeScript is totally ubiquitas. So the benefit of this addition is absolutely obvious, and therefore I guess other engines could follow this move. And if more than one or most of engines implement the stripping of type annotations, then it will be time to restart the proposal of typing in JavaScript. The proposal was once dead long time ago, but now the typescript is absolute standard in JavaScript ecosystem. So now we have ground for starting that again based on TypeScript syntax. If that happens, most of JavaScript toolings will be old, and everything need to be rewritten.</p>

<h3 id="user-content-flow">Flow</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These days I've been very much inspired by Flow concept by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. I've seen this concept several places, but most recently I paid attention to this concept because of <a href="https://note.com/kaerusanu/n/nc80f9523bb8e">this (Japanese) article</a>. This article is about the game designing. The author describes how to design a good game. The argument basically goes like this. The game is a luxurization of "learning". The player feel "joy" from games because the humans feels joy when they learn somethings. Humans work like this because they are incentivized for learning by nature to higher the probablility of survival by learning new skills. So the core of game consists of learning, and Mihaly's Flow describes the state of good learning. The author says inducing Flow in the users' mind is the key of good game design.</p>
<p>The author's theory itself sounded interesting to me, but when I read the article again and again, I got more interested in Mihaly's Flow itself. When I read carefully about the description of Flow, I felt that state is the state when I'm working on software in a very good way. So I felt Flow is something exactly I need in my every work. So I bought the book of Flow by Mihaly and also Bhagavad Gita, which according to Mihaly describes the same as Flow in very ancient age.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Iyo-chan and I went to Tokyo DisneySea on Sunday. Iyo-chan is a huge fan of Disney theme parks. So she knew everything about it, and on the other hand it was my first time to be there. So she guided me aroung the park and it was a wonderful time.</p>
