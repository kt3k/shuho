### linkedom

https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom

- This week I found a new DOM implementation, linkedom. Linkedom works in Deno as well.

### es-module-lexer

https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-lexer

- These days I've been learning es-module-lexer by Guy Bedford. This module is written in C, but it's compiled into wasm and published as an npm module, which is also usable from Deno via esm.sh. This 'parser' doesn't create an AST. It even doesn't create tokens. It skips reading everything except import and export statements. I wanted to enhance this module to support JSX, and tried a bit, but now I have no idea how to do that (probably it requires a lot of work, a lot of code).

### kt3k/deps_info

https://github.com/kt3k/deps_info

- Created a module called `deps_info` which analyzes the dependency of the script and recursively downloads the dependency. I'm trying to enhance packup to make it support css imports using this module. I'm still in the middle of that.
