## Tech

### GitHub Copilot

- GitHub announced the beta of GitHub Copilot, AI supported code completion service. People talk about this service very much.

### Rectrospective AMP

- Jxck looked back on AMP technology in his blog post. https://blog.jxck.io/entries/2021-06-26/amp-tone-down.html

  His theory on why AMP prioritized certain pages in search was interesting (seemed very much possible to me).

### React StrictMode

- I learned a little about React StrictMode. It's something like a runtime linter of React usage. It warns the usages of deprecated APIs, doubles certain lifecycle method calls, etc.

## MyApp

### Cascade

- I fixed the last bug before the release in iOS version of Cascade. I started preparing the release, but the process is incredibly messy and confusing.

## Hobby

### Zelda BOTW

- I started Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch. This is an amazingly well crafted game. Very interesting to solve the puzzles. Many surprises in game play like the previous versions of this franchise.
