## OSS

### denoland/deno

- This week I was working on the cache of CI of `denoland/deno`. I introduced mtime-restoring [python script](https://github.com/MestreLion/git-tools/blob/master/git-restore-mtime). It worked on some cases, but didn't work on some cases. The root problem was that mtime of files in build assets and mtime restored by the script sometimes have conflict. Bert created more regorous mtime-restoring script in node.js as github action which saves mtime from the actual mtime when the cache is created and restores mtime based on git object hash ([#10110](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/10110)). That solution totally solved the CI cache issue.

## Hobby

### lk0

- I've been experimenting with hobby language `lk0`. It's prototype language based on [the sequent calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus) of Gerhard Gentzen.
