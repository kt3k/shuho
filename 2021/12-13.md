## Tech

### Packup

- I finally wrote an article about packup, as a part of Deno Advent Calendar 2021. While writing it, I found that most advanced examples had stopped working at some point the past. I had to fix them before writing it, but at the end I resolved the all issues around it.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">Deno Advent Calendar 17日目、今年自分が開発した packup という Deno 用のフロントエンド開発ツールについての記事を書きました <a href="https://t.co/Z1C9PHH3xl">https://t.co/Z1C9PHH3xl</a></p>&mdash; Yoshiya Hinosawa (@kt3k) <a href="https://twitter.com/kt3k/status/1472536262976614400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Web Crypto API and JWT

- This week I was researching the way to verify the signature of JWT id token of OIDC login to Google. Google uses RS256 algorithm for signing it and it hosts JWKs at https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs. It took fairly long time to figure out the best way to perform it, but finally I found that all these verification can be done by Web Crypto API, SubtleCrypto's importKey and verify APIs.

  I'd like to write some article about this soon (probably first in Japanese).
