### JavaScript

- Found an interesting hack of using numbers as an iterable. I wish this would be a TC39 proposal.

### Next.js 12

- Next.js 12 was released this week. It's surprisingly introduced many features such as Middleware, Edge Runtime integration, URL imports, Support of Server Componet (!), etc. I'm a little skeptical about effectiveness of some of thoses features, but it's surprising that such mature software still brings such many major updates.

## Job

### Deno v1.15.3

- I did the release of Deno CLI and other tools by myself for the first time. It was a little stressful task, but it's important to be able to release it. So I got very satisfied after I finished it.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deno v1.15.3 has been released with bug fixes and performance improvements on all platforms.<a href="https://t.co/cfz6NNiw5p">https://t.co/cfz6NNiw5p</a></p>&mdash; Deno (@deno_land) <a href="https://twitter.com/deno_land/status/1452605173025710084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Deno Deploy beta 3

- We finally officially released `beta 3` of Deno Deploy. I worked a lot about the organization feature in it. Now you can share the projects with your organization members.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deno Deploy is now in Beta 3<br>✓ Outbound TCP and TLS connections<br>✓ DNS resolution<br>✓ URLPattern<br>✓ Playgrounds<br>✓ Organizations<a href="https://t.co/1M8aLnCv1Q">https://t.co/1M8aLnCv1Q</a></p>&mdash; Deno (@deno_land) <a href="https://twitter.com/deno_land/status/1453671097510072320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Language

### C-section

- When I talked with @ry about childbirth (because he's going to have a baby in November and I'm also in December or January), he used the word `C-section` and I didn't know the word, but I guessed it means "帝王切開" in Japanese and the guess was right.

  After the talk, I had strange feeling about the difference of C-section and 帝王切開 because these 2 sound too different and didn't look like indicating the same specific thing. So I looked into the etymology, and it was very interesting. C in C-section means Caesar, the emperor of ancient Rome. Caesarian-section became Kaiserschnitt when it translated into German, and Japanese language translated it as 帝王切開 (this translation is very literal). So now I can see this amusing equality: C == Caesar == Emperor == 帝王.
