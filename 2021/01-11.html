<ul>
<li>
<p>I contributed to the WebIDL, one of the spec of Web Platform. This was the first time I contributed to the spec of web platform. This task was derived from the PR in Deno in which I fixed the implementation of DOMException API. I found a little strange point in the previous implementation. Some of the error codes weren't mapped from the error names. I was curious about that "omissions" of the mappings. Then I found that some of the mappings were mistakenly dropped from the test cases many years ago in web platform test repository. I added thoses test cases and @domenic found that 3 of those missed mappings were already dropped from all the browsers (chrome, safari, firefox, edge). So we decided to dropped these non-existent mappings of error codes from the spec of DOMException API, and this became my first contribution to the spec of the web platform.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was preparing for the new job in Deno Land. I felt a little pressured because this is the first time I work in an international company, the first time I have to use English in my job, and the first time I work mainly on OSS in my work time. This job is totally new to me.</li>
