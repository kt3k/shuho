<p>Started thinking about features of a new app for mobile, <a href="https://scrapbox.io/kt3k/Spiral">Spiral</a>. It's mobile game app. A little bit similar to <a href="https://github.com/kt3k/krile-drive">krile-drive</a>, which I created long time ago. Probably I'm not gonna finish this app forever, but thinking about something new is interesting and fun.</p>
<p>I tried to create many 'game' app in the past (at least 3 iirc), but any of them didn't finish. One thing I was wrong during doing it was that I underestimated the amount of work of designing the levels. After having looked at some writings from the professional game creators, I learned that the work for creating levels take more than half of the entire work usually. I couldn't commit such amount of time in the past projects. Another thing I was wrong about was that I didn't create dedicated editor for that game levels. Usually I tend to be satisfied when I finished creating 'Game engines'. I wrongly supposed the game engine is the main part of game creation. But recently what I think is the main part of game programming is the game editor which integrate game engine in it. Such editor boosts the work of level designing.</p>
<p>Now my rough estimation for game creation is like: Game Engine: 1, Game Editor: 2, Level Design: 7. I want to try this hypothesis with Spiral this time.</p>
