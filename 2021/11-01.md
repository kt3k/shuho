## Job

### V8 API

- This week I largely worked on [denoland/deno#12633](https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/12633). This was my first time working about V8 API at work. First it was really confusing, but at last I felt I got familiar with the API. Basically what we can do in JavaScript is also doable in V8 API in a slightly different fashion. It was fun to learn it.

## Life

### Baby Goods

- We've finally prepared more baby goods this week.
