<ul>
<li>I research on flutter as a part of my consulting job (not a deno land job, but a tiny part-time advisory-type job). My conclusion is that it's not for web developers, but for app developers, as react-native is more for web developers.</li>

<p>I rethought about my life because I feel a little tired by the work in Deno Land. I love Deno. I believe it's the best dynamic language ever in software history, and I believe it's gonna keep being the best in next several (or more) years. So I'm so excited about being a part of this movement. This is true. But I'm not completely satisfied only working on it. While I consider Deno as "the best tool" for doing dynamic scripting, it's still only a tool for achieving something more important to me. I mean, Deno itself is not a goal to me. I need Deno for achieving my purpose in a better way, but it's still "a tool", not a goal. That's why I restarted learning mathematics this week. My current plan is to implement Gentzen's LK system somehow in the form of programming language (or something more like DSL). I written down the example of the proof in this language (it's still really early draft: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kt3k/694c0fd4b5cf1d9ad0aa79e60ee1de5e">https://gist.github.com/kt3k/694c0fd4b5cf1d9ad0aa79e60ee1de5e</a> ). Implementing mathematics in my own way is the one of the purposes of my own.</p>
<p>And another my main goal was something like making my own mobile game. I've been working on this topic really intensively in past many years, probably almost nearly ten years. My tools like <a href="https://github.com/capsidjs/capsid">Capsid</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kt3k/lepont">LePont</a>, <a href="https://github.com/strawjs">strawjs</a> (discontinued), etc were all about heading for this purpose. I tried several prototypes like "krile-drive", "the grid game", "Pairs", "Tententen", etc. But nowadays I'm feeling I'm changing this project in a little bit different direction. One of the reason I wanted creating game was that I wanted to create money from it, but now I think it's not good idea to make money from games because it's too "difficult" because of too many competitors. So now I feel like changing the purpose of this project into more of making something "meaningful" in some sense. Something which is very unique in the software world. I can't phrase this well in English, but anyway I want to keep trying making something very unique in mobile app ecosystem. And for that purpose I'll use Deno instensively in my own toolchain üëçüåßü¶ï</p>
