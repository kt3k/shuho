<li>The new HTTP API <code>Deno.serveHttp</code> has finally stabilized in main. This is a significant event because we finally settled on the design of http in Deno. This is the end of one of the long journeys Deno has been exploring.</li>

<h3 id="sha-3">SHA-3</h3>
<ul>
<li>When I was reviewing Jeremy's std/crypto <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/1025">PR</a>, I found I didn't know many of hash functions he was implementing. So I started googling each one and reading wikipedia articles. During it, I found that NIST organization held the competition called 'NIST hash function competition' in 2008 through 2012. In it, the algorithm called Keccak won the competition and it became 'SHA-3'. There were many competitors in it. BLAKE algorithm, which is included in std/crypto now, was one of the finalist. MD6, the successor of the famous MD5, couldn't pass the 2nd round. I've never heard of any the rest of the competitors, but I found it's fascinating that such competition existed. I'd like to look into the details of the algorithms of the finalists some time future.</li>

<p>Iyo-chan and I went to a Tonkatsu restraurant, Butagumi, Roppongi. The place was really classic Japanese style, and the dishes tasted very well.</p>

<h3 id="vaccination">Vaccination</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iyo-chan and I went to a vaccination venue for Shibuya residents (Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance "Century Hall") on Sunday, and we got vaccinated. We had reserved for 14:40 round, and we were on time. We got shots really quickly. Everything was finished before 15:00. It was an amazingly efficient operation.</p>
<p>After vaccinated, I felt pain in my left arm, where I got shot. It lasted like more than a day, but it disappeared on the next day. I also had a little headache on the day I got the shot, but it also disappeared on the next day.</p>
