## Hobby

### Spiral

- Started thinking about features of a new app for mobile, [Spiral](https://scrapbox.io/kt3k/Spiral). It's mobile game app. A little bit similar to [krile-drive](https://github.com/kt3k/krile-drive), which I created long time ago. Probably I'm not gonna finish this app forever, but thinking about something new is interesting and fun.

  I tried to create many 'game' app in the past (at least 3 iirc), but any of them didn't finish. One thing I was wrong during doing it was that I underestimated the amount of work of designing the levels. After having looked at some writings from the professional game creators, I learned that the work for creating levels take more than half of the entire work usually. I couldn't commit such amount of time in the past projects. Another thing I was wrong about was that I didn't create dedicated editor for that game levels. Usually I tend to be satisfied when I finished creating 'Game engines'. I wrongly supposed the game engine is the main part of game creation. But recently what I think is the main part of game programming is the game editor which integrate game engine in it. Such editor boosts the work of level designing.

  Now my rough estimation for game creation is like: Game Engine: 1, Game Editor: 2, Level Design: 7. I want to try this hypothesis with Spiral this time.
