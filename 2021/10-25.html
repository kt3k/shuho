<p>Found an interesting hack of using numbers as an iterable. I wish this would be a TC39 proposal.</p>

<h3 id="nextjs-12">Next.js 12</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next.js 12 was released this week. It's surprisingly introduced many features such as Middleware, Edge Runtime integration, URL imports, Support of Server Componet (!), etc. I'm a little skeptical about effectiveness of some of thoses features, but it's surprising that such mature software still brings such many major updates.</li>

<h3 id="deno-v1153">Deno v1.15.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I did the release of Deno CLI and other tools by myself for the first time. It was a little stressful task, but it's important to be able to release it. So I got very satisfied after I finished it.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deno v1.15.3 has been released with bug fixes and performance improvements on all platforms.<a href="https://t.co/cfz6NNiw5p">https://t.co/cfz6NNiw5p</a></p>&mdash; Deno (@deno_land) <a href="https://twitter.com/deno_land/status/1452605173025710084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We finally officially released <code>beta 3</code> of Deno Deploy. I worked a lot about the organization feature in it. Now you can share the projects with your organization members.</p>

<h3 id="c-section">C-section</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I talked with @ry about childbirth (because he's going to have a baby in November and I'm also in December or January), he used the word <code>C-section</code> and I didn't know the word, but I guessed it means "帝王切開" in Japanese and the guess was right.</p>
<p>After the talk, I had strange feeling about the difference of C-section and 帝王切開 because these 2 sound too different and didn't look like indicating the same specific thing. So I looked into the etymology, and it was very interesting. C in C-section means Caesar, the emperor of ancient Rome. Caesarian-section became Kaiserschnitt when it translated into German, and Japanese language translated it as 帝王切開 (this translation is very literal). So now I can see this amusing equality: C == Caesar == Emperor == 帝王.</p>
