### V8 private method crash issue

- I reported [issue-12500](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=12500) in V8 issue tracker a week ago and this week it was fixed by Shu-yu Guo in [review-3351167](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3351167). The cause seemed like some typing was wrong in JIT compiler.

### Down Jacket

- Iyo-chan bought me a down jacket of The North Face as a Christmas gift.
