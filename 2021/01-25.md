## Job

### Deno Land

- It was the second week in Deno Land. I felt I was getting a little better at listening English. At least I could discuss about relevant topics with the members. It's still a lot of challenge, but things are getting better little by little.

## Study

### TOEIC

- The result of TOEIC test came out this week. My score was 850.
