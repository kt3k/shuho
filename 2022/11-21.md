## Event

### JSConf JP

- I presented the talk, titled ['About `npm:` support of Deno'](https://kt3k.github.io/talk_jsconfjp_2022/), on Saturday in JSConf JP. I described the history and background motivation of `npm:` support in Deno.

## Hobby

### Beauty and the Beast

- Visited the Amphitheater in Maihama together with @iyoring, and saw the play of Beaty and the Beast by Shiki Theater Company. The play is based on the Disney movie of the same title. I like the scene where Belle and the Beast read the book of King Arthur together.
