## Life

### Move

- On Wednesday we moved to Toyosu area in Tokyo. This place is very convenient because the area has many large shpping malls, especially the biggest one is next to our house. We can access to most of necessary shops in life in a few minutes by walk. Also the new room has 3 bedrooms and 1 living room. It's much bigger than previous one (1 bedroom + 1 living room).
