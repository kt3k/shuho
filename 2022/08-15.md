## OSS

### denoland/deno

- Deno announced the roadmap of the near future. https://deno.com/blog/changes

  It will work on node.js compatiblity, module discoverability improvement, and performance.

## Tech

### Temporal

- Learned about Temporal API of ECMAScript. It's innovative in many sense. It can represent many new concept which wasn't possible with Date. I think it's good for the future of ECMAScript. However there seems a relatively high learning barrier, and I expect that the adoption of it would be a little bit slow. It's not simply a fixed version of Date, but it contains many new things. So people need some time to learn it.

## Life

### Covid

- I still suffered by Covid, and this week I didn't have fever or headache, but I started coughing very badly. I tested negative finally on the weekend, but the coughing is remaining.

### Rei

- This week's Rei! Rei is so cute 😊

### Cup

- I finally got a cup, called Edo Kiriko, from Sumida city. I ordered it last year via Furusato tax system. It was much more beautiful than I had expected.
