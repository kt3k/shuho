## Job

### Prisma + Deno

- Prisma released v4.5 on Wednesday, and it now officially experimentally started supporting Deno with its Data Proxy backend. I was so obsessed on this these days. I spent so much time on this. The feature was supposed to be released like 1 or 2 months earlier in the initial plan. It was finally released. I was so relieved by the announcement.

## Life

### Fireworks Festival

- Iyo-chan and I went to a festival of fireworks in Chigasaki. The fireworks are computer controlled and also synchronized with the music of Japanese pop group, Southern All Stars. It was so beautiful.
