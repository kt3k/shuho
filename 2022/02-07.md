## Tech

### Deno Deploy

- Deno Deploy finally [announced](https://deno.com/blog/deploy-static-files) the Static Files feature. It can store any static files in the managed store and they can be retrieved by Deploy instances. You can build your own vercel like system based on this feature, and also can be customized in any way.
