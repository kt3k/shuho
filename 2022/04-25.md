## Hobby

### VSCode

- Recently I work on VSCode extension in my spare time to create a VSCode Custom Editor for pixel art editing. This is my first time for working on VSCode extension (or any editor extension), and I'm very surprised by the complexity of the system.

## Life

### Barbacoa

- Went to Barbacoa in Roppoingi together with Iyo-chan and Rei-kun. We had special curry lunch, which was very delicious and gorgeous üòã We're now a little used to going out together with Rei-kun in stroller.
