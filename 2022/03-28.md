## Tech

### Supabase functions

- This week [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions) was announced. It's based on Deno Deploy, but it's provided as a service of Supabase. If you choose postgres as the backend of the service, then this integration of Supabase DB and Deno Deploy capability should be very handy because everything is managed under your supabase account.

  One thing I don't understand well about supabase functions is that they don't allow the functions to return html and that they either allow methods other then POST. These limitation looks very unnecessary and only limiting the possibilities of the usage. So your supabase functions can only have POST APIs and can't return HTML (though the original Deno Deploy has capabilities of both), which means you still need another service to return your service's HTML, which might be Vercel, CF Pages, Netlify, Deno Deploy, etc.

## Life

### 3rd vaccination

- The first half of this week was ruined by the 3rd vaccination. The maker was Pfizer. I wonder if I would take the 4th shot or not.
