## OSS

### Capsule

https://github.com/capsidjs/capsule

- Created a new frontend library "Capsule" this week. This is reinvention of what I wanted to do with "capsid", and this time I didn't use any experimental language feature, but only used existing ones.

  The runtime is 1.2 kb. TodoMVC is implenented in 3.45 kb. This is extremely small among other frameworks as far as I know.

  I'm going to use this tool in the next couple of hobby projects, expecially [Tiled Map]().

## Tech

### Astro became company

- The Astro framework team became a company this week. OSS tools / frameworks forming a company looks like a recent trend?
