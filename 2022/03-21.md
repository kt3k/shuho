### 3rd vaccination

- This week I took the 3rd vaccination on Saturday. I had a severe side effect on the 2nd shot. I was wondering how severe the 3rd shot was, but actually the 3rd shot caused far severer side effect. I had 39 degrees fever 2 days and I couldn't get normal until 4-5 days later. It was really severe.
