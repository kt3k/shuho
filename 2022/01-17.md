## OSS

### denoland/deno

- Deno v1.18.0 has been released this week. Now the config `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` is auto-discovered by CLI.

## Hobby

### Wordle

- I've been playing Wordle these days. More than 50% of time, the answer is out of my vocabulary. So it's fun to learn a new 5-letter English word everyday in a strange way.

## Event

### Denobata

- Had 6th Denobata meetup with @uki00a, @magurotuna, and others. Had talked about Deno v1.18.0, Zig language, etc.

### Career Interview

- Interviewed by Hatena Editors on Monday. The article on my past and present careers will be published next month.

## Life

### Rei-kun
