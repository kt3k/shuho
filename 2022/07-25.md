## Job

### `denoland/deno_std`

- This week I implemented `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` in `deno_std`, which were required by `chokidar`. Those were a part of node compatiblity work for Deno. I've never used these API by myself before, but I learned interesting details about them by implementing them.

## Hobby

### `@LittleWebExp`

- Recently I created a new twitter account @LittleWebExp and I've been drawing random pieces in that account. No specific reason to do this, but it feels just fun to me.

## Family

### Rei

- Rei is practising to crawl these days. He's very close to be able to do it, but it's not successful yet.
