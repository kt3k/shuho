## Tech

### FTX

- I've never heard of this crypto exchange service, but they got bankrupted this week and the amount of money that they can't return to the customers are incredibly huge. I'm not a big fan of cryptos from the beginning. Now they look so scary to invest any time, money, or energy into.

## Job

### WordPress

- My blog post about the combination of Fresh and WordPress was published this week finally!üçã‚úçÔ∏è The post includes the demo of how to integrate Fresh and WordPress and build a CMS with Fresh frontend and backed by headless WordPress. I believe this is ideal combination for doing CMS project in 2022. I'd use this architecture if I ran a small website developer company today. I was glad to see this work finally published.

## Hobby

### ONE PIECE

- I keep reading ONE PIECE by Eiichiro Oda for a while. Now I finished the volume 8. Now Sanji joined the Straw Hat Pirates.

  I mainly read it to criticize it. I really don't like it in many aspects. I don't like the storyline, the characters, the world, and almost everything! So my question is "Why is this manga series so popular in Japan and all over the world with such poor content?". I keep reading to find the anwer to that question.
