## Job

### Deno

- Released Deno 1.9.3 as a release manager. This was the second time I released Deno from my computer (actually release builds are built in CIs. So what I did is triggered CIs, writing release notes, incrementing version numbers, etc)

## Tech

### Web3

- The word 'web3' looks like really a wide-spreading buzzword on the internet now, and I don't find any arguments by proponents of web3 convincing. Ethereum, smart contract, or NFTs might be useful for something, but I don't find any current usage of them are useful. I'm also very concerned about the scalability of the blockhains. If majority of people started using them, the size of blockchains will start growing exponentially (at bigger rate). Can miners store the entire data of the chain forever? I don't think so. Ethereum full chain is already near 1TB, and it keeps growing already exponentially. This doesn't scale forever. The blockchain is not an economical way of using computers.

## Life

### Phone

- Bought a new phone!
