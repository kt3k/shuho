## Job

- We released Deno 1.29 with `npm:` improvements etc. I wrote the sections about the standard modules updates in the blog post.

## Event

### Terracotta army exhibition

- Iyo-chan, Meyu-chan, and I visited the Ueno Royal Museum to see the terracotta army exhibition. We saw some of actual terracotta army statues. It's always mind-blowing to see the great objects which were created in ancient ages.
