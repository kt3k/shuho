## Job

### Node compat

- We've been recently working on Node compatibility feature in Deno. We switched from `--compat` mode from `npm:` specifier. `npm:` specifier has some advantages. It can be enabled by default (in the future), and we don't have 2 different modes. `npm:` specifier is less invasive to the current deno ecosystem. All deno modules keep working as is, and in addition to that all npm modules work in Deno. So the change is purely additive to the existing Deno, not alternating it. The disadvantage is that we don't have the ability to start a script in Node context. That significantly reduces the compatibility. Many module don't work with this strategy. There seem still many problems ahead of us in this path.
