## OSS

### Igalia/wolvic

- Igalia announced to start its own mobile browser called Wolvic, based on Firefox Reality browser. Igalia having its own browser project sounds exciting to me.

## Tech

### Yarn

- Did a small poll on twitter about the version of yarn people use these days. They seem generally still using v1 of it. Probably `yarn node` is unpopular idea in the ecoystem. I totally understand it. Everybody is frustrated by the size of `node_modules` but replacing it with something completely different without enough explanation is unacceptable for most users.

  What yarn >= 2 tries to accomplish is very interesting, but it's too different from what the users of yarn v1 expect to happen with the next major version of this tool. I think they should change the project name to something else (such as 'berry'), just like perl 6 changed its name to `raku` at some point. I guess yarn >= 2 will never satisfies the expection of its v1 users.

### Headless Wordpress

- This week I found WordPress has the headless mode. It exposes RESTful API for retreiving their contents. I guess this might be better fit to the backend of Deno Deploy app. WordPress has enormous plugin ecosystem. Their admin pages are monstrously configurable by already available huge number of plugins. So they are so powerful CMS backend, and there are so many know-hows to deploy WordPress to virtually any infrastructure. Replacing its frontend with Deno Deploy should be quite possible and reasonable to do. I'd like to try it some day.

## Family

### My face

- Iyo-chan recently asks me "Did your face get longer?". No, my face didn't get longer! You look at Rei's face all the day and any adult's face feels longer to you! 😂
