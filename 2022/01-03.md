## Hobby

### Ancient Greek philosophy

- I've been reading the book of Ancient Greek philosophy by Noboru Notomi. This week I read a little bit of Aritotle's chapter. I found it very interesting that Aristotle left many dialogue type pieces, but they all lost in the Roman era. My image of Aritotle's works is like they are very difficult to read. They are written in very academic style and very hard to access, but that is only because the left work of Aristotle are all lecture notes for Lyceum, not because Aristotle only write in that way. More accessible book by Aritotle did exist in the history, but we can't access them because of the loss of the copies.

  On the other hand, Plato also wrote many books and surprisingly they all survived to the present day. There are clear difference to the destinies of the works of Aristotle and Plato.

  Plato and Aristotle are 2 greatest philosophers in ancient Greece in my view. It feels very surprising to me that the works of these 2 are treated such differently in the history.
