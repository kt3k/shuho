## OSS

### cloudflare/workerd

https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd

- Cloudflare finally open sourced `workerd` project. It is the core component of Cloudflare Workers. There are significant differences from Node or Deno. For example the entrypoint is Cap'n Proto settings file instead of a script.

  It states that the its purpose is being the core module of Cloudflare Workers, and not being a general purpose JavaScript runtime. So in my view this isn't a direct competitor to Node, Deno, or Bun in my view.

### denoland/deno

- Implemented `--allow-sys` permission flag to Deno in https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/16028

  This is the 8th permission flag. Deno added 7th permission flag (was `--allow-plugin`, then it became `--allow-ffi`) 3 years ago. It was the first time to add a new flag in 3 years.

  This work was necessary for stabilizing APIs such as `Deno.hostname`. Those stabilizations are required for supporting some of npm modules without `--unstable` flag.

- Wrote an article about how to receive file upload in Deno in Qiita https://qiita.com/kt3k/items/6461a59eef0f8ff18d44

  It was suprising to me that the parsing is all done in Web Platform APIs.

- Bought the poster from the merch shop.
