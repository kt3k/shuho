## Event

### denobata 11

- We had the 11th denobata meetup on Discord deno-ja server. We talked about v1.24 release, Sequoia's round, etc. This time hashrock also joined and we talked about the design of the logo of deno-ja community. He created many candidate designs and we finally decided to do poll for the last 4 candidates.

## Tech

### Carbon

- Googlers announced a new language Carbon this week. This language features explicit memory management like C/C++. They try to replace large scale C++ usages with this language.

  This language is very different from Rust because it doesn't have borrow checker. The Carbon team says in FAQ that if you can use Rust, then ignore Carbon ([ref](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/blob/trunk/docs/project/faq.md#if-you-can-use-rust-ignore-carbon)).

  This language is more similar to languages like C/C++, D, Zig, or V. This space now seems much more competitive.

  I personally anticipate this newcomer can compete very well here because 1) many Googlers look working on this and if they work full-time on this, it can develop really faster than other launages. 2) Googlers are generally very good at computer science and specifically compilers. Google has many CS degree holders in top universities, and they are perfect for working on this kind of project. 3) They have specific usages already in mind, huge Google's C++ code base. So the language can be soon battle tested in real world code base.
