## Tech

### Deno Advent Calendar

- I wrote [an article](https://qiita.com/kt3k/items/ec54346e9516b29291e8) in Deno Advent Calendar series. This time I wrote about [dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) again. When I wrote about it the last time, I focused on what it technically is and what can be possible. This time I put more emphasis on how to use it, what are the benefits of using it, why we should use it.

## Life

### 2022 wrapped

- I reviewed my 2022 in [a special artcile](https://kt3k.github.io/2022/) with a special graphic.

## Hobby

### Splatoon 3

- I became A-grade in Splatoon 3. My main weapon this time is Splat Charger. I used to use Shooters mainly such as Splattershot, N-ZAP, or Splattershot Pro in the past series. This time I started learning Chargers to understand what the game is like with these weapons. Chargers are more difficult in my view. The outcome tends to be more dependent to the skills of the player with Chargers. I enjoy learning it.
