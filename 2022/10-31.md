## Job

### WordPress

- Working on Fresh and headless WordPress integration stuff these days. I used to write a lot of PHP when I was in GREE in 2012 and 2013. I wrote some PHP in it for the first time in >=8 years.

## Life

### Cough

- I mostly recovered from cough, and also recovered from pain at chest for the first time in a few months. It was really painful time.

### Open Toy Gallery

- Found an open toy gallery near my apartment. Looked fun.
