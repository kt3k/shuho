## OSS

### Deno Merch

- Deno Merch has been released this week. Deno Merch is an official goods shop of Deno, and also one of the open source showcase apps of Deno Deploy platform. https://merch.deno.com/

## Tech

### Neom

- A twitter account called Neom has been promoting the project of a huge smart city in Saudi Arabia these days. That city is called The LINE, and they say they'll create it until 2030. To me this seems like a huge scam because the scale of the city is absurdly huge, and it's annoying to see such absurd/impossible project being promoted loudly in social networks.

## Life

### View of neighborhood

- The view of the neighborhood is very beautiful. It doesn't look like Japan. I like it very much.
