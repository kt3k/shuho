## Job

### WordPress

- Have been working on wordpress these days. WordPress seems very old and distant from modern frontend technologies, but it doesn't seem losing momentum, even keeping growing.

## Life

### twitter

- I cleaned up my followings. I used to set the rule that I don't unfollow people who follow me, but now I feel the rule doesn't make much sense. So I started unfollowing any people who feel less relevant to my life these days. Typically I unfollowed any people who I haven't communicated for years.
