## Tech

### A bug fix

- Wrote [an article](https://qiita.com/kt3k/items/77e715a790d84cd73878) in Qiita about a bug fix in `deno_std`. I fixed a bug of `iterateReader`, a small utility for creating an iterator from the given reader.

  It was actually a very difficult racy bug, and I elaborate on every step I took in debugging it in the article. Many developers seem interested and amused by it.

## Job

### Offsite

- I departed from Narita airport for the company's offsite meeting. In Narita airport, most shops were not operating probably because of too few customers because of Covid.

  I spent 4 hours in Doha airport. In contrast to Narita, there were so many shops operating even at 4am local time! I'm especially surprised by high brand shops like Tiffany, Hublot, etc are operating at 4am. Something which I don't see in any other places!

### Cough

- I'm suffered from heavy cough.
