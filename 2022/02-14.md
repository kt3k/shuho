## Event

### Developers' Summit

- I [presented Deno](https://kt3k.github.io/talk_devsumi_2022_deno/) at Developers' Summit 2022. I went a studio at Plutinum Tower, Shirogane Takanawa. The team who recorded the presentations was profesionals on broadcasting. So it was a bit of pressure to give my presentation in front of such team, but it was a really nice experience.
