<p>🦕 Deno is a new TypeScript and JavaScript runtime.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contributed <code>console.groupCollapsed</code>. We didn't implement this to only follow the whatwg spec, but abused it as a way of printing without a new line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This week deno was so popular in Japan 🇯🇵, and Japanese contributors and users of deno quickly started forming the community. We're going to hold the second meetup on deno on 19th of January!</p>

<h3 id="user-content-kt3kmoneybit-app">kt3k/moneybit-app</h3>
<p>💰 Moneybit is an open source mobile accounting app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subledger-modal has been completed. The most difficult part was the layout of each element on the modal dialog. I googled the images of General Ledger, but most of them are fit to PC's screen, and not for mobile phone. I needed to 'invent' the placement of the components inside it.</li>
<li>Next week, I'm going to write the unit tests of subledger-modal, which is probably the most complicated component in the app, and so it's worth to write the test for it spending the cost of time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-content-leaflet">leaflet</h3>
<ul>
<li>This week I worked for a startup company in Fukuoka. The task was to create a page in nuxt.js which contains a big map, map modals etc. I needed to place a leaflet map inside a modal which appears on another map. In the map modal, I needed to place further modal which contains another map 😂 So I created the sandwitch of maps 🗺🗺🗺 with vue.js! It was a good practice of programming maps.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-2019">2019</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-new-year-resolution">New year resolution</h3>
<ul>
<li>This year I want to think much about the properties of unknown things. I'm not talking about specific unknown things, but talking about unknown things in general for a person. I'm going to write in more details about this topic somewhere later.</li>
