<p>🦕 Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kt3k/build_deno_on_centos7">https://github.com/kt3k/build_deno_on_centos7</a><ul>
<li>This week I created a Dockerfile for building deno in CentOS 7. It was
successfully done. I also tries to build it in Ubuntu 12.04.5, but it failed
because <code>gn</code> crashes with the error of incompatible version of (again)
GLIBC! The binary version of <code>gn</code> seems depends on GLIBC 2.17, but ubuntu
12.04.5 seems depending on GLIBC 2.16.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="kt3kcoveralls-gradle-plugin">kt3k/coveralls-gradle-plugin</h3>
<p>👨‍🔧 The gradle plugin for coveralls</p>
<ul>
<li>This week I resumed the maintainance of coveralls-gradle-plugin, which I
created in 2014. It has only 233 stars, but it is apparantly used in
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Abuild.gradle+com.github.kt3k.coveralls">more than 4K repositories</a>.
So I feel a little responsibility of maintaining it, though personally I
stopped using coveralls in favor of codecov. In my opinion, codecov has big
advantages over coveralls. The API is essentially better designed, and now I
don't find any reason to keep using coveralls at this moment. Codecov supports
the users far better than coveralls. I asked several questions to both
coveralls and codecov. Coveralls never answered to my questions, but codecov
answered my questions always. But still I'm the only maintainer of
coveralls-gradle-plugin, so I have to maintain this plugin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kt3k/coveralls-gradle-plugin/pull/90">https://github.com/kt3k/coveralls-gradle-plugin/pull/90</a><ul>
<li>This time I updated gradle from 2.13 to 5.4.1. Interestingly this doesn't
break my <code>build.gradle</code> file. I was just able to update the version number
of gradle. I have to update some test cases, but they were also very small
things, and didn't require much efforts. Because of this change, I was able
to enable testing in oracle jdk 11. I had thought that there were some
problems in jdk 11 because there is
<a href="https://github.com/kt3k/coveralls-gradle-plugin/issues/85">an popular issue</a>,
which claims that it doesn't work with jdk 11. But strangely it passes CI
without any change. So now I don't see the cause of that issue.</li>

<li>This week we read the chapter 2. The farm is accidentally revolutionized. It
used to be called Manor Farm. Now it's called Animal Farm.</li>

<h3 id="ginzajs-1">ginza.js #1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joined ginza.js #1 with many friends. The venue was the office of PLAID. We
listened to the talks on the grass in their office. I liked @naru0504's talk
the best.</li>
