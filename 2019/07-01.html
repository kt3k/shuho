<p>🦕 Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>

<li>Continued to investigate the last part of the above work. In the above
branch I encountered the strange error which says <code>unique symbol</code> is not
assignable to <code>number | unique symbol</code>. It's strange because unique symbol
is assinable to <code>number | unique symbol</code> if these unique symbols are the
same. They must be the same but when I have a look at <code>deno types</code>,
surprizingly they are different. There were two namespaces <code>Deno</code> and
<code>io</code>. They both have <code>EOF: unique symbols</code> declarations. That's very
strange because in the source code, it's declared only once. But in type
declaration file, it splits into 2 different declarations, and they
conflicts with each other. I still cannot explain what causes this
situation, but maybe ts_library_builder handles the declaration files in a
slightly wrong strategy.</li>
<li>Anyway we merged the above PR with making <code>EOF: null</code> for now. That's a
little unfortunate, but I believe that works.</li>

<ul>
<li>Kat Marchan quit npm this week. I think this affects npm cli in future. In the
middle of the week, she's announced she's working on a new project of package
manager, which is a new frontend of entropic registry. The new project will be
written in rust. Before her quit, most leading engineers of npm had quit
already. I highly doubt their ability to continue developing npm cli further.
Especially to develop tink in this situation looks difficult.</li>

<h3 id="7pay-incident">7pay incident</h3>
<ul>
<li>Japan's biggest convenience store chain 7&#x26;i Holdings released a new payment
service, full of exploitable vulnerabilities, this week, and they immediately
lost a half million dollars. Payment service, full of vulnerabilities 🙈
They're still struggling to solve the issues.</li>

<h2 id="movie">Movie</h2>
<h3 id="snowpiercer">Snowpiercer</h3>
<ul>
<li>I've seen a movie called Snowpiercer in netflix. This is a sci-fi movie. This
movie depicts the rebelion of the people who are oppressed in a dystopia. The
world is in a very unnatural situation. The movie looked sometimes very
inconsistent and impossible, but I still liked this movie very much because
the the storyline is very dramatic and every part seems connected to another
part very well even in such ridiculous situations. Such spontaneous emergence
of dramaticity from the combination of ridiculousness reminded me the drawings
of Picaso.</li>
