<li>This PR made response.body of fetch async iterable. Apparently this PR
looks very easy one, but I first explored into a very wrong path and
consumed several hours trying to create entire

<h2 id="user-content-event">Event</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-ts-meetup-1">TS meetup #1</h3>
<ul>
<li>The 1st TypeScript meetup in Tokyo was held in the office of Microsoft in
Shinagawa. @leko talked about the puzzle of types, @jessidhia talked about the
efforts of modernizing pixiv's huge codebase, and @Quramy talked about
tsserver. Every presentation was great and I talked with people about many
topics at the party. It was very nicely organized meetup.</li>
<li>By the way, 2 days after the event, they started selling the tickets for the
next event, and they were sold out in 40 seconds. What a popular meetup.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-bokuwebnes-3">bokuweb.nes #3</h3>
<p>bokuweb.nes is the training camp of software engineers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3rd of bokuweb.nes happened on the weekend. This time we went to
Karuizawa, Nagano. We stayed 3 days (2 nights) in a house which we borrowed
with airbnb. The house was really good and clean. It was big enough for 6
people and the price was very reasonable compared to the hotels around there.
@bokuweb tried to emulate gameboy in golang. @tsuyoshiwada created TD4
emulator in rust language, compiled it into WebAssembly, and tried to run it
in browser. @ovrmrw mastered ruby from the ground up during the camp. @kuy
contributed to <a href="https://github.com/darklang/tablecloth">Tablecloth</a> about
floating point handlings. @rchaser53 contributed to <code>rustfmt</code>. I created
<a href="https://github.com/kt3k/deno_td4">TD4 emulator in deno</a>, did
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/2520">an issue</a> in deno (see above),
and <a href="https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/381">played</a> with vlang.</li>
