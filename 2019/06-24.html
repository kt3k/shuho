<li>I'm working on the breaking updates of the Reader interface. This is one
of the necessary features for v1.0. It compiles and passes the tests, but
it has a little anomaly in <code>deno types</code> output. I'm still trying to solve
it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Our robot <code>SQ2</code> was displayed in G20 summit in Osaka. I didn't go to the
venue, but many pictures appeared which showed SQ2 there. I liked the one
which showed SQ2, our manager Sungjae Kim, and Taro Kono the Minister of
Foreign Affairs.</li>

<h3 id="user-content-reactjs-tokyo">ReactJS Tokyo</h3>
<p>ReactJS Tokyo is a meetup of react users in Tokyo.</p>
<ul>
<li>React users gathered in Mercari's office in Roppongi on Wednesday and listened
to the talks about React. My ex-colleague @taneba presented his experience
about <code>react-testing-library</code>. I liked his technique to create the report of
the test specs and share it to non-engineers. That process seemed promising.</li>

<p>🐢 Tokyo Node Gakuen is a Japanese local conference of Node.js users.</p>
<ul>
<li>We had 34th Tokyo Node Gakuen in Gran Tokyo South Tower on Thursday. This time
was a special conference for the reports from JSConf EU 2019. @yosuke-furukawa
talked about the package managers. We had 3 major updates from package
managers: Tink, Yarn v2, and Entropic. Tink and yarn seemed heading for the
similar directions, but entropic seemed having a very different goal. They all
proposes very different way of managing node.js programs. I can't say which is
better, but anyway they all try to change the node ecosystem significantly.
@dorayakikun talked about the Workers, which is the service for edge computing
by CloudFlare. @leko talked about the history of Web API adoptions in node.js.
@akito0107 presented his own tool
<a href="https://github.com/akito0107/marron-glace">marron-glace</a>, which is a very
typescript-friendly option parser. Talks were fantastic and the party was nice
as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-content-deno_ja-5th">#deno_ja 5th</h3>
<p>🦕🇯🇵 <code>#deno_ja</code> is a Japanese local meetup of Deno enthusiasts.</p>
<ul>
<li>This time we gathered at the office of LoiLo Inc. We talked about the recent
changes of Deno and each person worked on their own issues. @hashrock worked
on his delectron, a tool like electron, but written in Deno. @locol23 created
the bundle script by <code>deno bundle</code> and successfuly rendered the DOM using
react, crazy work. In the meeting, we decided to join the TechBookFest 7 (22th
Sep, 2019), and registered to it. I brought there the stickers I created the
last week and they were so popular.</li>
