<p>🦕 Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>

<li>I tried to update Permissions API to web standard one. Deno now uses its
own APIs for permissions, but we realized W3C defines browser's standard
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permissions API</a>.
So we decided to switch to that APIs. But my first attempt failed because
the required change was so big and I couldn't finish it in a proper way.
So I closed it for the moment.</li>

<h3 id="in-house-lt">In-house LT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gave a LT about frontend engineering in general in the office of SEQSENSE. It
was only for the employees of the company. It was a little diffult for me to
prepare the talk because I'm not used to talking about frontend engineering to
the general audiences. I'm used to talking about some specific topics of
frontend engineering to the frontend engineers, such as babel, webpack, etc.
However talking about the entire frontend engineering was a huge challenge to
me. I don't find similar talks frequently in local conferences because they
also usually talk towards some specific audiences in specific area. They
suppose many things and often go into the very detail of the topic. In the
preparation, I remeber the talk by Pamela Fox almost 10 years ago. I heard the
talk on site. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-o9dFDzi4">talked</a> about
the history of the browsers from the first days of the internet. So I borrowed
some topics from her talk such as the first html pages, etc. The talk was, in
my view, successful. Many people asked many questions to me after the talk,
which was rare in recent conferences/meetups.</li>

<h3 id="borrowingownership">Borrowing/Ownership</h3>
<ul>
<li>This week I found that swift language and D language are aiming to implement
borrowing and ownership feature in the languages. For now, rust is the only
language which has this feature, but it seems that everyone now agrees that
the feature is good and efficient in the programming, and that authors started
thinking to introduce it in thier languages.</li>
