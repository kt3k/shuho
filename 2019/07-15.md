- Contributions

  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2668
    - Small contribution. Enabled zoom feature in benchmark charts. Maybe useful
      for all hisotry charts.

- https://gist.github.com/kt3k/8d84ec348ee5c71b221a403a28539cac
  - I wrote an article in Japanese about why I contribute to deno. Got some
    feedbacks from Japanese tech community, especially from JavaScript
    community.

## News

### Kyoto Animation massacre

- A terrible disaster happened in Kyoto. A guy killed 34 people in Kyoto
  Animation studio, a famous Japanese animation company. He set up fire in the
  building with gasoline. The fire burnt the entire building, and it resulted
  such many victims. This was so sad.

### Election of Upper House

- Election of Upper House was held on Sunday. This was the last election before
  the raise of VAT in October. The raise of VAT usually have bad effect to the
  goverment because we, Japanese, don't like VAT, and sometime it causes the
  resignation of the PM or even the change of the goverment. This time the
  ruling parties (LDP and Komeito) decreased the seats, but kept more than half.
  So this election doesn't change anything. It was a little unexpected result to
  me.

## Life

### Cold

- Caught a cold on weekend. I couldn't sleep well before that because of the
  high temperature at night. Maybe that was one of the causes 🤒
