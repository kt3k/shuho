<blockquote>
<p>The weeknote for 8/5 - 8/11.</p>

<h3 id="denolanddeno">denoland/deno</h3>
<p>ü¶ï Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Still writing my chatpters for the book. My first chapter is heavily inspired
by the book of Python by @kamatari. His way of introducing new items to people
who really don't know them is awesome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c3jsc3">c3js/c3</h3>
<p>üìä C3 is a chart library based on D3.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/c3js/c3/releases/tag/v0.7.4">https://github.com/c3js/c3/releases/tag/v0.7.4</a><ul>
<li>@panthony continued contributing this week. We released version v0.7.4 üéâ</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="job">Job</h2>
<h3 id="broken-message">Broken message</h3>
<ul>
<li>A very difficult bug happened on our agent process. Probably the tcp data is
cut in the middle because of inappropriate timeout behavior of the library
we're using. As a result, broken binary data comes in to our system. It
produces another broken message with absurd properties. It happens only once
or twice a day. We receive millions of data a day. The reproduction rate is
very low. That makes it difficult to debug this failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="animation">Animation</h2>
<h3 id="puella-magi-madoka-magica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a TV animation series with 12 episodes which was popular 8 years ago
in Japan. I've never seen this before, but this time I've finally seen this
one. It was amazingly good. The plot was very original and interesting. I also
liked the supporting roles like the mother and teacher. They were well played.</li>
<li>The bad point about this series is, in my opinion, the picture! I don't
understand why they choose such childish style.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<h3 id="cold">Cold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Caught a cold. First the throat started itching, then aching. Then I couldn't
breathe well, and couldn't do anything. I don't remember after that well, but
after sleeping almost 2 days I felt good and everything started going normal.</li>
