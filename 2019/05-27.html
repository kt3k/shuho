<h3 id="animal-farm">Animal Farm</h3>
<p>üêñ Animal Farm is a classical allegorical novel by George Orwell.</p>
<ul>
<li>This week we read the chapter 3. The revolutionized farm has started well.
Animals produce the products so well like human farmers did. They organize
several committies to educate themselves. I liked the paragraphs where some
animals struggle to learn alphabets. What inspired the author to write these
paragraphs? At the end of the chapter, the governing species pigs started
declaring that they have the privilege to have milk and apples exclusively.
One of the seven commandments of the farm is broken now.</li>

<h3 id="harajukusquare">HarajukuSQuare</h3>
<p>HarajukuSQuare is the meetup organized by @seqsense.</p>
<ul>
<li>We gathered at the office of @seqsense at Harajuku. We listened to the talks
of @kamatama41, a JAFCO guy, and @AtsushiSakai. @kamatama41 talked about his
careers, Tenho MahJong, and
<a href="https://github.com/kamatama41/terraform-provider-unofficial-travis">his own terraform provider</a>.
The talk by the JAFCO guy (I forgot the name) was actually very interesting.
His company talks with about 2,000 startups every year and only invests to 20
among them. @seqsense is the company which belongs to that 20 in the
year 2017. He also said that one of the current trends of their investments is
Live Streaming. I thought their investment itself is a very good indicator of
how promising a company is. Finally @AtsushiSakai presented about the
competition called Formula Driverless Student. This is a competition of auto
driving a car which has similar spec as Formula 1. I enjoyed listening to the
stories of a very different world.</li>
