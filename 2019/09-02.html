<li>Implemented Response.statusText. This was necessary for my book to explain
the fetch response object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2855">https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2855</a><ul>
<li><code>deno version</code> command used to use V8 Isolate for showing the version
number. This PR changes it. Now <code>deno version</code> is only processed by the
rust side. It's partly done by @nayeemrmn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2864">https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2864</a><ul>
<li>We used to use rollup-plugin-replace for replacing arbitrary symbols in
TypeScript source code. That was handy technique, but we recently ditched
rollup and now that string replacing behavior was very naively performed
in our source code. This PR removes that hack and simply passes everything
on start up message from rust to V8. The extension of such message has
become really easy because of the recent ops infrastructure change. The
messages are now simply JSON. So what I needed to do was just adding
fields to a JSON object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2877">https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2877</a><ul>
<li>Response.bodyUsed wasn't implemented. I tried it, and it wasn't difficult.
I had a little concern about the timing when the bodyUsed becomes true,
but when I checked it in Google Chrome, the browser seemed making it true
immediately after the response.text() called. So I mimicked that behavior
in the above PR.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A big change in build pipeline happened this week. Rollup was removed. We now
load scripts one by one and take the snapshot of the entire state. By doing
this, we don't need any script bundler! This was a big surprise to me. I've
never imagined that such a way even existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then we removed <code>//tools/build.py</code>. This was a big step forward because
now we build with standard <code>cargo build</code> command. This means anybody now can
add any crate as a dependency. The rust side of deno is now truly open for
everyone to extend.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<ul>
<li>This week lambda started releasing the update which speed up the cold start up
time of lambda functions which connect to VPC. It used to be very very slow
because of the start up time of ENI was very very slow. Now AWS provides new
infrastructure for ENI initialization. So the lambda is now very quick to
start up üëç</li>

<h3 id="csrf">CSRF</h3>

<li><a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/csrf-is-really-dead/">https://scotthelme.co.uk/csrf-is-really-dead/</a><ul>
<li>According to the above article. Google Chrome is to change the browser's
default behavior around <code>SameSite=</code> attribute of Set-Cookie header, and the
article says it will result the end of CSRF attacks. I've never checked the
above assertion in detail, but if it's true, we can simplify the typical web
development process significantly.</li>
