<h3 id="user-content-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood">Once upon a time in Hollywood</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seen a movie "Once upon a time in Hollywood". Directed by Tarantino, starred
by Leonard DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. I liked the role Brad Pitt played. I always
like unsophiscated-type roles that are played by Brad Pitt. The other examples
are a crazy guy in 12 Monkeys, a guy in Burn After Reading, and a lieutenant
in Inglourious Bastards. They all really look who they are and don't look Brat
Pitt at all. The worst role he played was, IMO, the character in World War Z.
That role really didn't need Brad Pitt. Any average Hollywood star could play
that role at equal quality with him. It was really a waste of Brad Pitt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-politics">Politics</h2>
<h3 id="user-content-we-are-going-right">We are going right</h3>
<ul>
<li>These days it seems to me that Japanese society is going to very very right.
Less and less people seem critical to the government, and if a person is
critical to the recent politics againt Korea, then that person will be
criticized intensely from every direction. I think the media were more
critical to the government by default at least a few years ago. However it
seems now very difficult for a public person in media to be critical to the
government. I'm not sure whether it's controlled by someone or it's just
naturally in this way, but anyway I feel strongly that it's different from
what it used to be in a few years ago in Japan.</li>
<li>Maybe we're changing our values for some reasons. Some good things go bad now,
and some bad things go good now. I just need to adjust myself to fit those
values to live with them because I just don't want to fight with them
politically.</li>
