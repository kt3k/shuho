<p>ü¶ï Deno is a new JavaScript and TypeScript runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributions<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2643">https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/2643</a><ul>
<li>Added onload and <code>load</code> event handling to <code>window</code> object. This feature is
inspired by the <code>load</code> event of the browsers. We can use <code>window.onload</code>
as the main entrypoint of the script.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-ts">window.onload = async function() {
  const res = await fetch(Deno.args[1]);
  console.log(await res.text());
};
</code></pre>
<p>This script shows the contents from the url given from the command line
argument. There is no explicit call of <code>onload</code> function above, but it's called
automatically by the system when the script is loaded.</p>

<h3 id="s3sync">s3sync</h3>
<p>‚ôªÔ∏è s3sync is a Golang utility for syncing between s3 and local.</p>
<ul>
<li>We, engineers at SEQSENSE, created and open sourced
<a href="https://github.com/seqsense/s3sync">s3sync</a>, a small golang utility for
syncing between s3 and local disks. The similar function is available as AWS
cli's subcommand <code>aws s3 sync</code>, but we need more efficient one in regards to
the size and speed for using it in our robots. So we created this library.</li>
<li>Special thing about the testing of this library was that we first used
<a href="https://localstack.cloud/">localstack</a> for testing. Localstack is a mock
implementation of AWS and can be used as a 'fake' AWS in testing environment.
We set up the testing of this library using localstack. That simplified our
test code significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="event">Event</h2>
<h3 id="ts-meetup-2">TS meetup #2</h3>
<ul>
<li>We, TypeScript users near Tokyo, gathered in Folio's office and listened to
the talks about TypeScript. @mizchi's talk was the most accessible to the
beginners of TypeScript like me. @takepepe's talk was by far the most
high-level and excellent. @Quramy talked about the graphql support of the
typescript language server. He introduced his tool <code>ts-graphql-plugin</code> and
described how he approached when he created this tool.</li>
<li>By the way, Folio's conference room is terrible (maybe the worst among the
places I've ever been). Why did the room's designer place the screen from the
ground level? The audience can see only the top 20% of the screen (!) unless
they are in the front row.</li>
