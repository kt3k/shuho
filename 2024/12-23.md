## Job

### AES GCM mode

- I added support of the initialization vector of any length with GCM mode in aead-gcm-stream crate https://github.com/littledivy/aead-gcm-stream/pull/3, which indirectly fixed the compatibility bug of Deno with Node https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/27441

  It was interesting to implement the calculation of initial block by reading the official spec. One tricky part was that there's outdated version of the spec available on the internet, and unfortunately I first tried to implement it first. After struggling to match the result with Node version of cipher a few hours, I realized that there's another version of the spec, which was actually the true spec..

## Event
