## Job

### Deno Offsite

- This week the company had Deno Offsite in Larvik, Norway. We had number of discussioins, presentations, etc there. The most intense one in my view was the discussion about new registry idea. We explored the idea of using `npm` registry as the primary registry of Deno. In my view the idea looked really confusing as Deno module system is not compatible to Node.js at all (The idea was nearly at the agreement, but a week later it was dismissed somehow).

## Life

### Self-service bag drop

- While travelling to/from Norway, I first did 'self-service' bag drop in some airports. I've never done this before and I didn't know bag drop can be self service. It was a little confusing at first, but once I learned it, I realized it's quite convenient.
