### Offsite

- Started travelling to Norway by SAS, Scandinavian Airlines to join the Deno Offsite there. It's my first time to go to Norway.

  I met a Norwegian guy in an English school in London in 2015. His name was Ramon. He said he was an actor, but I'm not sure that was true. I learned from him a Norwagian phrase "Hvordan har du det?" meaning "How are you?" in English. Interestingly he said that the answer to that greeting is always "bra" meaning "good" even when you're not good at all. In the Norway offsite, we met a black female person, who was preparing our conference room, and she didn't speak English very well (BTW most Norwegian people we met were able to speak English very well. That person was almost the only exception). I tried the above greeting to her. She looked surprised by it, but the answer was actually "bra". What Ramon told me looked very true.
