## Job

### Frameworks

- Continued on framework detection works. I found it's interesting that many framworks, such as Svelte, Qwik, Remix, now depend on Vite for building their own meta frameworks. Relatively old framworks such as Next.js, Remix don't follow this pattern. Nuxt uses Nitro for routing infrastructure. Nitro is also an interesting abstraction as infrastructure of meta frameworks.
