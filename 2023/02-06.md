## Game

### Tekken 8

- I found this week that Bandai-namco is creating Tekken 8. I used to be a big fan of Tekken series. I used play a lot. I was expecting that Tekken 7 would be the last of the series because of less popularity in this genre in general. So the announcement of 8 was a little bit of surprise.

## Hobby

### Heike Story

- I watched [the Heike Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heike_Story) series together with Iyo-chan. It depicts the historical development of Samurai families at the end of Heian era. It was a sad and impressive story.
