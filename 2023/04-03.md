## Tech

### CSRF

- In [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) repository, Andy was writing the doc article about POST request handling. After seeing it, I started wondering what is the best way to mitigate CSRF attacks in 2023. In the end I found `SameSite=Lax` attriute of cookie is very very clever and well thought mechanism to mitigate them. I've heard of it for long time, but I felt I didn't realize its usefulness sufficiently.
