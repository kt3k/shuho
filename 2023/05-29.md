## Tech

### WASIX

https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wasix

- WASIX was announced this week by Wasmer. It's a superset of `wasi_preview1`. `wasmer` runtime already support it and many open source programs are compiled into wasix. `wasmer` runtime implements the command like `wasmer run --net curl/curl -- http://neverssl.com`. It looks very similar to `docker run` command. It can run the program on the internet with the single command with less overhead than docker. This looks like the future of software virtualization.

### V8

## Hobby

### Zelda

- I've been playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom these days. This week I unlocked the first 2 lightroots. It was an incredible moment because I accidentally got there by falling into the chasm near Kakaliko village. Everything there was so strange, weird, and amazing.
