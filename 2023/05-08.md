## Tech

### Dart

- Dart 3 was announced this week. It's announced that Dart 3 is sound. That's probably significant achievement for gradually typed language.

### pronoun.is

- I found that pronoun.is is now dead (probably because of the change of terms of use of Heroku) and it was written in Clojure.

## Job

### GitHub API

- Was interacting GitHub API this week. I found a bug with the endpoint ["Create a repository using a template"](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-repository-using-a-template). When I was calling this API, the call never succeeded and the error message was unintelligible. After a number of tries I finally reached out to the support. After a few communications, we found that the access permission is required for the template repository itself (whic should have been unnecessary when the template repo is public). We ended up using a little complicated workaround to it.

## Hobby

### Midjourney

- Played a little with Midjourney. `mandala` keyword gives interesting results.
