## Tech

### `svh`

- This week I learned about a new css units, [`svh` and `svh`](https://coliss.com/articles/build-websites/operation/css/large-small-dynamic-viewport-sizes.html). These are available in all browsers. `svh` doesn't include the height of overlapping UI component, such as address bar in mobile browsers. `svh` corresponds to what is actually visible in the mobile. I was looking for this for a long time.

### Deno KV

- Deno KV started the open beta this week. https://deno.com/blog/kv-open-beta

  I think [This comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37396244) in hacker news from Simon Willison describes very well why Deno KV is an interesting technology.

### Bun 1.0

- Bun 1.0 was announced this week. Surprisingly they added experimental support of Windows at the very last moment. I expected it couldn't make it, but they did.

  I tried Next.js again with Bun, but it still doesn't seem working.

## Life
