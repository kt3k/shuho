## Tech

### Unity

- Unity changed its license and started charging for each install of the app using Unity when the company revenue is above certain level (There seems also an option of revenue share of 2.5% instead of install fees).

  This change seems reacted extremely negatively from the developer commmunity of Unity. Some already declared the switch to other engines such as godot.

## Hobby
