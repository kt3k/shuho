## Hobby

### Zelda

- I've been playing the latest of Zelda series, Tears of the Kingdom. It's quite fun. The special abilities (i.e. L button things) are all different from the previous ones, and all of them are very much more powerful than the previous specials in my view. Been quite enjoying so far.

### VSCode

- I'm working on a project of vscode custom editor. Nothing works yet, but I keep refactoring the official custom editor example. After looking at each part of it, I found so many redundant things. Maybe they are for the future enhancement, but they are also just unnecessary to me. After reducing the basic example less that half of lines, I understand custom editor protocol much better.
