## Life

### Relatives

- On Sunday we went to Nagoya and met many of the relatives of my father's side. Rei first met them.

  I felt a little sad when I heard they (the relatives in Nagoya) lost in touch with some of my cousins and it's probably very difficult meet them in the future.

  On the next day we met the parents and grandfather of Iyo. The father and grandfather first met Rei there.
