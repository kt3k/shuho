### Mojo

https://k0kubun.hatenablog.com/entry/mojo

- I've read the review of Mojo project by k0kubun who work on JIT of Ruby. Mojo is a super set language of Python. It adds some keywords like `struct`, `fn`, etc to enable more type safe, perfomant options. Mojo is currently not completely compatible to Python yet, but it aims to be completely compatible with Python. So they try to make the entire python ecosystem usable from Mojo. This project looks really promising to me as Python is still one of the most popular languages in 2023 and its ecosystem is huge. Adding type system to Python while keeping the compatibility is really in a good direction.

  The project is led by LLVM and Swift creator Chris Lattner and his company Modular AI.
