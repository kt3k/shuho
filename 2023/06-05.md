## OSS

### kt3k/ulid

- Ported ulid module for Node.js to Deno. ULID is a reasonable 128-bit (or maybe 130-bit) alternative to UUID, which has time-based bits and random bits combined. The ids are naturally order by generation time because of its leading time bits.

## Tech

### Sold

- Rui Ueyama reviewed his attempt to make business based on his OSS project `mold`. The result wasn't successful. He couldn't make enough money from the proprietary version of mold, `sold` linker. The lesson here is that it's very difficult to make a big business only from an OSS project, especially with his model, selling proprietary version of the OSS. He regrets he didn't choose SaaS like model.

## Event

### Yokohama

- I went to the Chinese town in Yokohama with @syumai, @yusukebe, and others. We had spicy chinese lunch. It was very good.
