## OSS

### denoland/deno

- This week we moved Node.js polyfills in Deno from `std/node` to Deno main repository.

  https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/17724

  Node and npm compatibility is now the main feature of Deno and they need to be quickly loaded. So this change was inevitable. Also this move enables us to use any internal APIs of Deno. So we can more flexibly implement Node.js polyfills, that means we have more ways to optimize the performance of Node.js polyfills in Deno.

## Tech

### PHP

- This week I learned that PHP doesn't support Windows anymore at version 8.0. I think this means they are completely dropped from the general purpose dynamic language category.

## Life

### Bag

- This week I bought Iyo-chan a bag by Hermes. It's called Herbag. We found this bag very luckily on the shop in Ginza.
