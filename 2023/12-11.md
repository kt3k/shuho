## Event

### Next Web Conf

- I joined Next Web Conf 2023. I led Edge Computing session. I talked with many people there. The conference is orgnized in a very special way. The speakers are not allowed to demonstrate something or promote some specific products. This regulation is insteresting, but I didn't actually like it. I probably will never do this again.
