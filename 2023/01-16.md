## OSS

### denoland/deno_std

- I need to shim `crypto.createSecretKey` to provide better npm compatibility to Deno, but this week I found that `crypto-browserify` doesn't have the implementation of it because it's relatively new API and `crypto-broserify` effectively ended its development in 2018. I'm probably going to need to read the internals of `crypto` in very much in details in near future.

## Job

### Frontend

- I've been implementing the frontend of a new service this week. Frontend engineering always gives me pleasure. I always enjoy learning new things (especially CSS related stuff) that browser introduced lately. This time I first used `<dialog>` tag. It doesn't affected by parent dom, and it works like a DOM element created directly before closing `</body>` tag. It's very convenient for controlling dialog type component.

## Life

### Family

- Iyo-chi, Rei and I went to a restaurant, called `bills`, in Daiba, Tokyo. We had pancakes and a breakfast plate. They were very delicious.
