## Job

### Web Mock up

- I've drawn mock up of web pages for the first time in a while. I often implement designed pages as frontend code, but rarely mock them up. A rare and nice experience to have.

## Hobby

### ONE PIECE

- Keep reading ONE PIECE comic. Now the protagonists are fighting against Arlong. Arlong is a bad guy, and he's aware of it. It's very much the same pattern as the previous villains. I'd say it's kind of boring, because these villains are all very similar in their characters.
