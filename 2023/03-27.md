## Tech

### Firefox

- I started using Firefox a little seriously these days. Chrome quite often freezes on my M1 macbook especially during interacting with the input boxes (typical example is the twitter's tweet input). The same input box doesn't freezes with Firefox, so this shouldn't be web app error, but browser error of Chrome.

### ChatGPT

- I keep trying ChatGPT these days, but I never found it satisfying. It always hallucinates. I can't trust it. When I correct it, they pretend they understand, but actually they don't understand it, and make similar mistakes again and again. In my view they don't have an ability to "understand" things.

## Job

### Deno KV

- I was working on Deno KV dashboard in Deploy. It was interesting to understand how Deno KV serializes keys and uses FoundationDB under the hood.

## Life

### Rei's shoes

- We bought the first shoes for Rei. They are very small.

  And we started practicing walking outside.
