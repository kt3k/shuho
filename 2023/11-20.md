## OSS

### denoland/deno_std

- I finished [`std/expect` work](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/pull/3814) this week. It started long long time ago, and a couple of people started working on it, but nobody actually finished them, and the task was stalled for a long time.

  This should have important meaning to people who consider migrating from Node.js to Deno. Now Jest is the de facto standard testing framework for Node.js, and now `deno_std` has `testing/bdd.ts` and `std/expect`. The most basic part of Jest is now covered by `deno_std`.

### denoland/deno

- I wrote test coverage improvements plan in Deno issue this week. https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/21325

  The goal of this plan is to make the coverage reporting feature on par with `jest --coverage`. I believe this makes total sense. Having best builtin tooling is the best selling point of Deno. The existing state of coverage reporting support is far below the expectation to it. Deno should make it at similar level as Jest at least.

## Life

### Sick

- Iyo-chan and Rei were very sick in the weekend. They couldn't eat well.
