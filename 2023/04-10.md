## Tech

### AI hype

- AIs are now very much hyped. I'm not convinced with the impact of them. They are useful sometimes, but they don't seem as impactful as the invention of the internet or the web.

## Job

### BigInt

- I was implementing the serialization of BigInt this week. It was less trivial than I expected.

## Event

### Meetup

- I met @syumai and @yusukebe at a Chinese restaurant in Nihonbashi.
