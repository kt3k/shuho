## OSS

### denoland/deno

- I used math to fix a flaky test for the first time (probably). https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/21475

## Tech

### Iterator helpers

- @petamoriken wrote [an article](https://zenn.dev/pixiv/articles/6f406804f6a820) about how the iterator helper proposal team has been trying to mitigate the break the web issue of the proposal. It is very complex and very interesting. I found this is similar as the situation of the movie [TENET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)) where the people from the future fight against the people in the past.

### Falsy

- This week I found that falsy is typed as `false | 0 | 0n | "" | null | undefined` in TypeScript (though this misses the case `NaN`). Isn't this interesting? Is there any other language in which falsy concept can be typed explicitly? Ruby is probably a nice example, where falsy is `false | nil`, which is intentionally designed so.

## Hobby

### Japan Car of the year 2023 - 2024

- Prius won the Japan Car of the year 2023 - 2024. I correctly predicted it. Prius had extraordinary exterior design among the candidates.
