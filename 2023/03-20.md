## Event

### `#edge_study`

- I gave [a presentation](https://kt3k.github.io/talk_deno_deploy_2023/) about Deno Deploy in a meetup, [#edge_study](https://web-study.connpass.com/event/277480/). I first met @yusukebe in person there.

  In it, I learned that Cloudflare build many product by using their own products. I found it an interesting way to expand its business.
