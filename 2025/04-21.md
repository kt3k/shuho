## OSS

### denoland/deno

- I added automatic reporter support to `deno test --coverage` https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/28260

  This change makes `deno test --coverage` roughly on par with `jest --coverage` in terms of DX. You'll get almost everything you need about coverage reporting with the single command `deno test --coverage`.

## Family

### Iyo-chan

- Iyo-chan has finally started going to her company for the first time since she started her maternity leave 3 years ago. On that day, Kei-chan was very sick at stomach and I took a day off to take care of her.

## Hobby

### Game

- Found a mobile game, called Juice King. This one is very good among these kinds.
